      <dt>So, you are interested in solar?</dt>
      <dd>
        Then the first question you need to ask yourself is, 'how much energy do I need?'.
        This app will help you identify your usage and therefore the size of the system.

    <dl>
      <dt>Prioritize - Need, Want and Luxury</dt>
      <dd>
        Usage is broken down into priorities so you can hone in on what 'you really need'. 
        You may find, as many have, that going off-grid makes you change some life habits - and is very expensive. You might want to take some of those Luxury items off the table and move some of those Needs into Wants.

      <dt>Will solar save me money or the planet?</dt>
      <dd>
        Not in the short term. A grid-tied systems gives you the best likelyhood of saving money eventually.

            Off-grid systems are expensive, not green, and won't ever save you money.

    <dl>
      <dt>Will I need a generator?</dt>
      <dd>
        Yes - almost always. Especially if you want to be ready for an emergency when the grid goes down (and your grid-tied system does not work).
        <p/>
        Solar is not the best thing 'for emergencies'. Even with an off-grid solar system you will need to account for weather conditions - so you will need a generator for backup and battery maintenance. I recommend a propane generator since the tanks last indefinately and are widely available.

        This app will help you understand how much energy the typical US household uses. 
        Quite a bit, it turns out, at least when you consider 'going solar'.
