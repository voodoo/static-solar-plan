      <dd>
        Just a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=kill+a+watt">watt-meter</a> and some diligence. 
        You can get your total use from your electricity bill. 
        This app will help identify how each appliance is contributing to your bill.
        It may also help identify 'phantom loads' - electriciy that is being billed that is  unexplainable.
        <em>The average use for a US household is 1000 kWh a month. </em>

      <dt>Why is usage broken down into Need, Want and Luxury priorities?</dt>
      <dd>
        So you can hone in on what 'you really need'. 
        You may find, as many have, that going off-grid makes you change some life habits - and is very expensive. You might want to take some of those Luxury items off the table and move some of those Needs into Wants.

      <dt>Will solar save me money or the planet?</dt>
      <dd>
        Not in the short term. A grid-tied systems gives you the best likelyhood of saving money eventually.

            Off-grid systems are expensive, not green, and won't ever save you money.

    <dl>
      <dt>Will I need a generator?</dt>
      <dd>
        Yes - almost always. Especially if you want to be ready for an emergency when the grid goes down (and your grid-tied system does not work).
        <p/>
        Solar is not the best thing 'for emergencies'. Even with an off-grid solar system you will need to account for weather conditions - so you will need a generator for backup and battery maintenance. I recommend a propane generator since the tanks last indefinately and are widely available.

      <dd>
        This app will help you understand how much energy the typical US household uses. 
        Quite a bit, it turns out, at least when you consider 'going solar'.

            From a development perspective, get back to the basics.
