# Solar Plan

## Goals

1) Avoid javascript framework fatigue

2) The simplest, modern, client side app possible

3) Run from the filesystem - and server (avoid ajax)

4) Use localstorage https://github.com/marcuswestin/store.js/

5) Client templating https://github.com/blueimp/JavaScript-Templates

6) *Learn about electricity and solar*

## Dependencies

* Compile template views:  https://github.com/blueimp/JavaScript-Templates#compiled-templates
* Watch template changes: https://github.com/vol4ok/nwatch/blob/master/fswatch.rb
* Store data locally: https://github.com/marcuswestin/store.js/

### Jquery and bootstrap

I'm currently using them but am looking for alternatives. 
They account for 80% of the code for this app and I'd like to bring that figure to 10%.
